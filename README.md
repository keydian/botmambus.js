This is the repository where my shitty-ass meme-ass mambus-ass bot is stored for Heroku hosting and if any of you want to add any extra features.
So far it includes the following features:

j!github links this page.
j!help tells you to j!github, RTFM.

Now includes MongoDB implementation for more funsies.

Yeah that's it, it took me more time to try to fix Heroku working with Maven and Java than to switch to Node.js and redo the entire bot and manage to get the hosting
working. It is what it is I guess.
