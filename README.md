This is the repository where my shitty-ass meme-ass mambus-ass bot is stored for Heroku hosting and if any of you want to add any extra features.
So far it includes the following features:

-> Reacts to any message including "birra" and "damasio" with appropriate emojis

-> Hands you a "Copo de JoÃ£o Leite" when you send a message including "leite"

-> Replies with some "Mambus Stranhus" (leftover code) when you send a message that includes "mambus"

-> j!quem command para "Quem te perguntou".

-> j!penis displays a penis which is collectively grown by the usage of the words "micropenis" and "macropenis"

-> j!pingrandom pings a random member of the server. Spicy.

-> j!github links this page. j!githubrc links Legatheaux's GitHub page, on the RC2020 rep.

-> j!help seemingly worked if you're seeing this.


Yeah that's it, it took me more time to try to fix Heroku working with Maven and Java than to switch to Node.js and redo the entire bot and manage to get the hosting
working. It is what it is I guess.
